# EmuTOS Documentation #

This repository is for [EmuTOS](https://emutos.sourceforge.io/) documentation. That consists for now of a user manual.

Note to contributors: The HTML manual is served by GitHub Pages from the 'gh-pages' branch that is automatically updated. Please do not modify the 'gh-pages' branch manually, as your changes would be overwritten. Just push your mkdocs source code to the 'master' branch, as usual.
